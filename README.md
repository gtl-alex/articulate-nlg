## Conceptual NLG

A natural language generator that articulates simple thoughts as words, phrases, and sentences.

## How It Works

With Conceptual NLG, you define personas that can articulate concepts (represented as strings) as speech text.

For instance, a particular persona might articulate the concept `"greet"` as `"hello"`, `"hi"`, or `"hey"`.

Another persona might articulate that same concept as `"oy!"`, `"yo!"`, or `"sup!"`.

The generated text for a concept is typically random and can even reference other concepts.
