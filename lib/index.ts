/**
 * A core contains all concepts for a Persona. Think of it as the brain!
 *
 * Each concept name in the conceptResolvers property maps to either a single resolver, a single string as the generated text,
 * or a list of resolvers/text. Resolvers provide the generators that are used to generate text.
 *
 * Resolvers/text for a particular concept are randomly chosen during articulation. The selection is based on
 * weights for each resolver provided for that concept. Weights default to 1, and if no weights are provided, all resolvers for that
 * concept are equally likely to occur. If strings are provided, the weights for those default to 1 as well. If only
 * one resolver (or just a string of text) is provided, it's always selected.
 *
 * For instance, the "greet" concept might map to a list, `["hello", "hi", "hey"]`. Since these are just strings,
 * articulating "greet" would generate text by randomly selecting one of those three strings, and all would be
 * equally likely to occur since their weights are all 1 by default (1/3 chance each).
 *
 * If the list were something like: `[{do: {text: "hello"}, weight: 18}, "hi", "hey"]`, then "hello" would have
 * an 18/20 chance of being selected, while "hi" and "hey" would each have a 1/20 chance.
 *
 * There is a resolver that articulates other concepts, making it possible to reuse them. For instance, a `greet`
 * concept could be reused in a `how-was-your-day` concept, which could start by articulating `greet` and
 * then asking how someone's day was. The `greet` concept might resolve in a dozen different ways, making the greeting
 * different every time. Layer your concepts like this and your speech will seem much more organic!
